	Here you can see the list of ingredients registered in the system. Ingredients are managed by <a ui-sref="app.alastair_chef.admins">Alastair-Admins</a> and you can not change them yourself. This is to avoid cluttering the database with non-english or duplicate records. If an ingredient is missing, contact one of the admins to add it for you.
