  <p>
  Here you can see the events that are getting organized by Alastair. Until the oms-events reworking is finished, is impossible to implement proper access controls to only allow event organizers to edit anything related to an event, so please don't fiddle with other people's events. Until that rework you will see all present events here.

  <p>
  Per event you can see a shopping list and meals. Each meal accomodates an arbitrary number of meals, so you can design a meal to fit guests with different preferences. Per recipe you can specify the number of people you want to feed with this part of the meal and Alastair will automatically calculate the amounts fitting to this
